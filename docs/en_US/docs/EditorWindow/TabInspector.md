# Extended Inspector

This allows you to treat the Inspector like a browser tab. This is an Inspector that is fixed to one object, so the display content does not change even if you select another object. This window is not opened from the menu bar, but from the + icon on the toolbar at the top of Unity. If you do not have the + icon, you can add it by turning on the `Add Inspector Tab Button` in the Toolbar Extensions of Preferences.
